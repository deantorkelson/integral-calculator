# integral-calculator
This integral calculator is the inte-greatest. 

Follow the prompts from the code and you're good. 
So long as everything you input is a number, i.e. no letters,
then the code will handle the rest. Simply put in the number
of terms (including zeroes), and then the coeffecients. 
For example, x^3 + 1 has 4 terms, 2 are just unwritten.
The function includes 0x^2 and 0x^1, so don't forget those
when you input your function. 

Note that this integral calculator is a rough approximation,
but you can asympotitically approach the real value of the 
integral by increasing the number of trapezoids.

Happy integrating!
